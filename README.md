## Description

From the original proposal: There are many independent artists in Los Angeles who have useful materials they want to get rid of. While there are online resources available to facilitate the donation and sale of these materials (Craigslist, OfferUp), there isnâ€™t one designed specifically for the arts community.

Supply Interchange LA is an app that allows for the exchange of used/leftover/discount art supplies and related materials and tools. Registered users will be able to post items to a simple UI by category with descriptions and basic contact information in order to connect with other users. While not an e-commerce app per se, the site will include a donation button to help fund this free service.

Note: This app is a work in progress (not fully functional) created initially as a group project for UCLA's Coding Bootcamp in 2021. The contributors to the project: Albert Fonseca, Jun Hwang, Joe Merrell, and Timo Nlemvo.
